The core class of Comet.ml is an Experiment, a specific run of a script that generated a result such as training a model on a single set of hyperparameters.
An Experiment. will automatically log scripts output (stdout/stderr), code, and command line arguments on any script and for the supported libraries will also log hyperparameters, metrics and model configuration.

The Comet Optimizer is used to dynamically find the best set of hyperparameter values that will minimize or maximize a particular metric.
It can make suggestions for what hyperparameter values to try next, either in serial or in parallel (or a combination).
