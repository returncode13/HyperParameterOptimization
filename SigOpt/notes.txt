What is SigOpt:
SigOpt is an ensemble of Bayesian Optimization techniques, which finds a natural use case in hyperparameter tuning

Basics:
Experiment: https://app.sigopt.com/docs/overview/create
Optimization Loop: https://app.sigopt.com/docs/overview/create

Choosing the objectice metric:
This is a crucially important step, as an improperly formed objective can lead to improperly formed models
